                <strong>• Prep Ingredients Before Cooking (Mise en Place)</strong>: Always measure, chop, and prepare all your ingredients before you start cooking. It keeps the process smooth and ensures you do not forget anything.
                <br><strong>• Taste as You Go</strong>: Regularly taste your dish while cooking to adjust seasonings and ensure the flavors are balanced.
                <br><strong>• Master the Basics</strong>: Learn essential techniques like boiling, sautéing, roasting, and baking. Once you master the basics, you can experiment and create your own recipes.
                <br><strong>• Do not Overcrowd the Pan</strong>: When frying or roasting, leave enough space between ingredients. Overcrowding lowers the temperature, resulting in steaming instead of browning.
                <br><strong>• Use Fresh Herbs and Spices</strong>: Fresh herbs and quality spices can elevate the flavor of any dish. Remember to add fresh herbs at the end for a burst of flavor.
                <br><strong>• Let Meat Rest Before Cutting</strong>: After cooking, allow meat to rest for a few minutes. This helps retain its juices, making it more tender and flavorful.
                <br><strong>• Save Pasta Water</strong>: When cooking pasta, save a cup of the starchy water. It is perfect for making silky sauces that cling to the pasta.
                <br><strong>• Invest in Good Kitchen Tools</strong>: A sharp knife, sturdy cutting board, and quality pans can make cooking easier and more enjoyable.
                <br><strong>• Experiment and Have Fun!</strong>
